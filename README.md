# Process-Scheduler
Program simulates CPU scheduling algorithms first come first serve (FCFS), shortest remaining time first (SRTF), and 
Round-Robin (RR) with a specified quantum value. Input file is a list of process, one per line, each containing a name, 
an arrival time, and a burst time. Program takes context switching into account and calculates average burst, wait, 
turnaround, and response times. Output is seen on the command line.
